# Script to begin the Bayesian inference of what a word refers to.

# Prior heriarchical structure determines the linkage between different object trees.
# An object tree is, for example, dalmatian --> dog --> animal 
# An object is defined by its position in the tree and its distance from other objects

# A word's reference space is defined by the size of things that are connected to it in the object tree
